      <h2>Please come visit Kansas. We haven't had a single tourist in two decades. We are getting pretty lonely here.</h2>
      <p>Here are some of the many reasons you should visit Kansas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We have food!</li>
          <li>We sometimes have water!</li>
          <li>We sometimes have power!</li>
          <li>Outhouses next to every shack!</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Here is what our visitor said back in nineteen hundred and seventy-one:</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"My time in Kansas was so fun, I got lost in a duststorm and haven't left"</p>
